The general AI takes 3 different ambient conditions of the clorella algae into account to calculate a specific carbon capture capacity.
The used ambient conditions are:

1.  The Ambient temperature (in Grad Celsius)
2.  The CO2-proportion of the air (in abs numbers between 0 and 1)
3.  The light intensity ( in LUX)

The outcome:
-> The CO2-capture capacity (in abs numbers between 0 and 1)

The data which is used is not avaiable, but there is the possibility to generate the data due to algorithms. The profound data is coming from:

Prof. Dr. Dr. Haim Trebes (Max Plank institute of algae research)
